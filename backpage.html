## The Spit Gripes

**By Arthur Pumble, Your Concerned Citizen**

Ah, another week, another deluge of epistolary effluvia from the good (and largely agitated) denizens of Remy and its sundry, increasingly unkempt environs. One might think, given the relentless march of progress – or at least, the relentless march of *something* – that the populace would find more pressing matters to stew over than the precise shade of Mrs. Higgins' fuchsia geraniums. But no. The human condition, it seems, is a finely tuned instrument of irritation, constantly seeking new frequencies upon which to vibrate with indignation. And who am I, Arthur Pumble, your humble (and increasingly grizzled) arbiter of vexation, to deny you your catharsis? So, without further ado, let us plunge headlong into this week’s **'The Spit Gripes'**.

***

**Garden Ghouls and Brass Bellows**

Dear Mr. Pumble,

I write to you, not with a quill sharpened by civility, but with a pen dipped in the bitter gall of utter despair at the state of neighbourly comportment in this once-respectable corner of Cromer. For months, I have endured what can only be described as a veritable *slum* next door. The garden, sir, is less a patch of green and more a hazardous waste site, complete with a collection of rusting garden implements, an inexplicable mannequin leg protruding from a shrub, and what appears to be a perpetually deflated paddling pool acting as a stagnant birdbath. One might tolerate a certain degree of domestic eccentricity, but this is an affront to common decency and, I daresay, property values!

And as if this visual blight weren't enough, evenings are now regularly punctuated by the mournful, off-key bellow of a tuba, sometimes as late as midnight. Tuba! In a residential area! Is there no respect left for the sanctity of quiet enjoyment? I dread to think what the tourists make of it. Surely 'Cromer: Home of the Perpetual Tuba and Mannequin Leg Garden' isn't the message we wish to send.

Something must be done before this descends into utter anarchy.

Yours,
**Outraged of Cromer**

***

*Ah, the sweet symphony of suburban discontent. One man's artistic expression is another's late-night bowel spasm, it seems. And the mannequin leg... well, one must have *some* decor, mustn't one? Let's see what the other side has to say...*

***

**A Different Perspective on 'Evolving Ecosystems'**

To the Editor,

I read with a certain degree of bemusement (and indeed, a faint whiff of something suspiciously akin to *judgment*) a letter last week regarding... well, certain aspects of local living. It's truly fascinating, is it not, how different individuals perceive the world?

Some of us, for instance, consider a garden to be a vibrant, evolving ecosystem, rather than a sterile monoculture dictated by the whims of a certain well-manicured aesthetic. My 'collection,' as it was so quaintly put, of 'rusting implements' are in fact invaluable tools awaiting tender restoration – a hobby some might find more enriching than, say, obsessively pruning rose bushes into submission. As for the 'mannequin leg,' that, dear reader, is a piece of found art, a statement on discarded consumer culture, and provides much-needed support for a particularly ambitious climbing rose. And the paddling pool? A vital rainwater collection device, promoting self-sufficiency and reducing our ecological footprint. Perhaps some find it easier to complain than to understand the deeper philosophical currents at play.

Regarding the 'tuba,' I must confess to a momentary lapse of memory as to any sustained, late-night cacophony. However, I *do* occasionally practice my bass brass instrument for the local community orchestra – a noble pursuit that brings joy to many (especially myself). Perhaps the sound carries more than anticipated. One does hope one isn't inadvertently disturbing those who, one assumes, retire rather early and prefer the dulcet tones of, say, a ticking clock to the rich timbre of a low C.

It's a shame, really, that some people focus on the trivial when there's so much beauty and creative expression to appreciate around them.

Yours in quiet contemplation,
**A Puzzled Resident (of Cromer, naturally)**

***

Ah, neighbourly love. A delicate bloom, often trampled underfoot by the heavy boots of 'artistic expression' and 'philosophical currents'. One wonders if these two ever actually speak, or merely communicate via increasingly exasperated letters to yours truly. A potent reminder that while walls may make good neighbours, a thick pair of earplugs and a blindfold might be even better.

Keep your gripes coming, folks. The more vitriol, the better the ink flows. But do remember to stamp your letters. Even I, Arthur Pumble, have my limits when it comes to subsidising your righteous indignation.

Until next week, may your gnomes remain static and your tubas be muted.

**Arthur Pumble,**
**Your Concerned Citizen (and aspiring recluse).**

        <div class="seance-section backpage-gossip">
            <h2>The Seance: Madame Fifi Channels the Dead</h2>
            **SEANCE WITH FIFI: A BARK FROM THE BEYOND**

*By Madame Fifi, Resident Canine Oracle, 'The Remy Digest'*

Right, you lot. Another week, another deluge of pathetic human queries about lost socks, unrequited glances, and the ever-present dilemma of whether to invest in artisanal catnip or just stick to the bargain bin stuff. Frankly, it’s all rather *déclassé*. Don't you people have actual existential dread to be dealing with? Or at least a decent biscuit to consider?

Nevertheless, my duty, as a creature of superior intuition and impeccably groomed fur, calls. The cosmic leash tugs. Today, we're not just plumbing the depths of your feeble anxieties; we’re going interstellar. Yes, *interstellar*. Because frankly, the spirits of the recently departed are becoming dreadfully repetitive. "Oh, I regret not telling Brenda I loved her!" *Snore.* "I wish I'd seen the Northern Lights!" *Yawwwn.* Give me a celestial challenge, or at least a ghost with a good story about a rogue ham sandwich.

So, for your edification and my amusement, I have dragged from the ether a spirit of true cosmic significance. One whose journey was, shall we say, *unconventional*. Prepare yourselves, mortals, for the disembodied thoughts of **Laika**, the Soviet space dog. Though I suspect her primary cosmic concern wasn't geopolitical one-upmanship, but rather the acute lack of decent kibble in orbit.

*Silence descends, punctuated only by Madame Fifi’s gentle snuffling and the distant clatter of what sounds suspiciously like a stolen tea biscuit.*

***

**LAIKA'S LAMENT (From the Great Beyond)**

"Ah, space. One rather expected... more. The ascent was, shall we say, *brisk*. Like an overly enthusiastic game of fetch with a rather large, metallic stick that kept getting faster. And the view! All those stars, twinkling like distant, utterly unreachable tins of premium pâté. A cruel irony, really. My last meal was a paste. A functional paste, mind you, with all the nutritional promise of a damp cardboard box, but utterly devoid of the *joie de vivre* one expects from a final supper.

And the smells! Or rather, the *lack* thereof. Where was the rich, earthy perfume of a forgotten bin? The complex bouquet of a public park on a Tuesday? Just the sterile tang of metal and... nothingness. It was profoundly disappointing. I kept expecting a sudden burst of bacon, or at least a passing comet smelling faintly of gravy. Alas, just the cold, silent, *odorless* void. Utterly without flavour. The indignity!"

***

There you have it. Humanity, always reaching for the stars, for glory, for the grand narrative. And what does the spirit of the pioneer truly reflect upon? The profound absence of a decent, greasy meal and a good sniff. Typical. Humans build rockets; dogs just want a decent walk and a treat. Priorities, darling, priorities.

Now, if you'll excuse me, all that channeling has made me terribly peckish. I believe there was a forgotten ham sandwich – possibly two days old, a vintage year – under the intern's desk. The spirits tell me it’s calling my name. And who am I to ignore the wisdom of the great beyond?

*Until next week, keep your paws clean and your biscuits fresh.*

*Yours in cosmic cynicism,*
*Madame Fifi.*
