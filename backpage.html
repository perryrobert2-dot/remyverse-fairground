            ## The Spit Gripes

Another week, another deluge of bile and petty grievances spluttering onto my desk like an over-caffeinated pigeon. It warms the cockles of my cynical heart to see the citizens of Remy still possess the fortitude to complain, even if their prose is often as murky as a forgotten teacup. So, pull up a mouldy armchair, adjust your spectacles (preferably not the ones you dropped in the toilet last Tuesday), and let us delve into the festering pus-pocket of public opinion. Remember, folks, silence is consent, and we wouldn't want anyone thinking you're *agreeable*, now, would we?

**THE PHANTOM MATTRESS & THE BREADMAKER CONUNDRUM**

To the Editor,

I write to you today, not merely as a disgruntled citizen, but as a sentinel of civic order, a man whose very sense of decorum has been assaulted by a most egregious act of neighbourhood chicanery. I refer, of course, to the recent ‘Phantom Booking’ incident that has cast a pall over our usually *predictably* dismal street.

Last Tuesday – our esteemed bin night, for those who still adhere to such quaint notions of responsibility – I bore witness to a sight that curdled my tea. A rather *disturbing* queen-sized mattress, mottled with stains that hinted at unspeakable domestic tragedies, and a broken breadmaker that had clearly seen better, non-toast-related days, appeared on the curb. Now, normally, one might assume a legitimate bulky goods collection. But this, my dear Remy Digest readers, was no ordinary collection. This was an *impostor*.

You see, Mrs. Higgins, bless her cotton socks, had meticulously booked one of her precious *two collections per household per year* for bulky goods. A booking *requiring foresight* and adherence to Council diktats. Yet, when the truck arrived, it was not Mrs. Higgins’ meticulously bundled garden clippings (destined for the green bin, of course, if she hadn’t missed her Tuesday slot due to an ingrown toenail) nor her carefully segregated yellow bin recyclables (Containers & Glass). Oh no. It was this monstrous mattress and the pathetic breadmaker.

As any *responsible* resident knows, our red bin is for General Waste (Landfill), not for industrial-scale mattress disposal, nor should the green be confused with a portal to shed one’s unsavoury past. These items clearly exceeded the capacity of any standard Tuesday collection, and to suggest they originated from Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose sole indulgence is a miniature schnauzer and a subscription to 'Knitting Today!', is preposterous.

I strongly suspect a nefarious individual, perhaps residing at #42, who, having perhaps *missed* their own opportunity to book a collection, brazenly usurped Mrs. Higgins’ slot. The gall! The sheer, unadulterated *audacity* to foist one’s personal, probably legally questionable, detritus upon an unsuspecting neighbour’s municipal allowance! This isn't merely theft of services; it's a moral blight upon our fair Cromer. I urge vigilance, and perhaps a discreet surveillance camera focused directly upon the nefarious activities of those who think themselves above our Council Bin Rules.

Outraged of Cromer.

**A NEIGHBOURLY OBSERVATION ON 'OUTRAGED'**

To the Editor,

I feel compelled to respond to 'Outraged of Cromer's' recent epistle regarding the 'Phantom Booking' incident. While I commend their fervent dedication to our local Council Bin Rules – indeed, who among us doesn’t sleep soundly knowing our yellow bins are exclusively for Containers & Glass, and our red for General Waste (Landfill)? – I must confess to a certain bewilderment.

'Outraged' speaks of a 'disturbing queen-sized mattress' and a 'broken breadmaker' appearing on the curb. It's rather interesting, isn't it, how certain items appear almost *magically* just before a *pre-booked* bulky goods collection? Especially items that seem to match the description of a particular, rather *distinctively stained*, mattress that was, only last week, quite visibly perched on the veranda of a certain property, not three doors down from Mrs. Higgins. And the breadmaker? A familiar, sickly yellow, much like the one that used to emit a rather unsettling smell from that *same* residence's kitchen window on Tuesday bin nights.

One might almost suspect that 'Outraged of Cromer' possesses a rather convenient memory, or perhaps a selective blindness when it comes to their own domestic detritus. To suggest that these items *didn't* originate from their own abode, and then to point the finger at a hard-working neighbour at #42 (who, coincidentally, *did* have a bulky goods booking for the *exact same day*, only to find their slot inexplicably filled), shows a remarkable talent for projection.

It's almost as if someone *else* had a legitimate bulky goods booking, only to find their precious two-per-year allowance hijacked by... well, let’s just say, a rather 'concerned' neighbour who perhaps *needed* to dispose of some particularly incriminating domestic items without, shall we say, *attracting undue attention* to the origin of said 'disturbing' mattress. Perhaps 'Outraged' should invest in a better quality mattress – and a mirror.

With enduring neighbourly observation,

The Neighbor at #42.

---

Ah, the sweet symphony of neighbourly distrust. It warms the cockles of my cynical heart to see such an exquisite display of passive-aggression and thinly veiled accusation. 'Outraged of Cromer' seems to have found themselves in a rather sticky situation, much like that queen-sized mattress, I dare say. And 'The Neighbor at #42'? A true connoisseur of the subtle jab. My only regret is that I wasn't there with a bag of popcorn. Until next week, keep those grievances brewing, folks. The Remy Digest thrives on your misery.
