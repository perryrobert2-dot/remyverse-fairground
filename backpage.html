                <h2>Arthur Pumble's Mailbag</h2><div class="letters-section backpage-gossip">## The Spit Gripes with Arthur Pumble

Good heavens, another week, another sack of grievances dropped off by a postman who frankly looks as if he’s seen a ghost – or perhaps just glimpsed the contents of your average *Remy Digest* 'Spit Gripes' column. I, Arthur Pumble, your humble, increasingly-beleaguered custodian of public pique, present the latest offerings from the great unwashed, the terminally vexed, and those simply in need of a good, old-fashioned moan. Do try to keep your fury contained to the page, dear readers; my therapist tells me the flying spittle from these missives is doing untold damage to the antique Venetian blinds.

***

**SOUNDS OF THE ABYSS**

Dear Mr. Pumble,

I write to you today not merely in a state of mild annoyance, but in a veritable tempest of righteous indignation! For years, our quiet little cul-de-sac in Cromer has been a bastion of civility, a testament to proper British living. One could hear the gentle hum of the refrigerator, the distant cry of a seagull, or perhaps the faint, dignified rustle of a broadsheet being turned.

No more, sir, no more! The very air is now polluted with the incessant, brain-drilling thrum emanating from the premises of my new next-door neighbours. Not content with their unsightly garden gnomes – one of which appears to be flipping a V-sign, I might add – they have installed what can only be described as a *subwoofer*. A device, I am reliably informed by young Kevin down the road (who works at PC World and knows these things), designed specifically to vibrate one's very fillings loose!

Last Tuesday, during the precisely 7:47 PM broadcast of 'Midsomer Murders', my heirloom china cabinet began to perform a jig! My prized collection of commemorative spoons clattered like castanets in a Spanish tavern! And the bass, Mr. Pumble, the bass! It's like living next to a perpetual colonoscopy, a rhythmic internal disturbance that leaves one feeling simultaneously nauseous and utterly bereft of peace.

I have attempted polite communication, a note slid under the door referencing the 'audible disturbances' and the 'delicate nature of antique porcelain'. I even left a copy of the Noise Abatement Act 1960 highlighted in luminous yellow. Was I met with understanding? With remorse? No, sir! Only with louder thumping, which I suspect was some sort of primitive drum and bass 'music', accompanied by what sounded suspiciously like a cackling hyena and the occasional shriek of 'GET IN!'

This is not progress; it is barbarism! It is an assault on the eardrums, the nervous system, and the very fabric of genteel society. Mark my words, Mr. Pumble, if this 'music' continues, I shall be forced to take matters into my own hands, and I warn you, my whist drive is next week, and I am in possession of a particularly shrill dog whistle.

Yours, still vibrating,
**Outraged of Cromer**

***

Ah, the sweet symphony of modern living. One man's cultural enrichment is another's dental appointment. And 'Midsomer Murders' *is* sacred, Outraged. I sympathise entirely. Though I must admit, a gyrating china cabinet sounds like something one might pay good money to see at an avant-garde theatre festival. But I digress. Let us now hear from the other side of the fence, or perhaps, the other side of the offending bass line...

***

**A HARMONIOUS NOTE**

Dear Mr. Pumble,

I am writing in response to the rather quaint letter from 'Outraged of Cromer'. While I naturally wouldn't wish to imply anything about the delicate sensibilities of certain individuals who perhaps prefer the soothing sounds of *silence* – a preference I find terribly limiting, personally – I do feel compelled to offer a slightly different perspective from someone living in the general vicinity.

One does try, does one not, to embrace the vibrant tapestry of contemporary life? To foster a spirit of 'live and let live', even when faced with, shall we say, *traditionalist* neighbours who view anything livelier than a funeral dirge as a personal affront.

My humble abode, recently redecorated to reflect a more *modern* aesthetic, has indeed hosted a few small, entirely spontaneous gatherings. We find the occasional 'rhythmic soundscape' quite conducive to relaxation after a particularly trying week of, well, *living*. I have no doubt that some of the more *energetic* vibrations (which are, incidentally, excellent for circulation) might briefly register with those possessing an acute ear for... everything.

As for garden ornaments, taste is, of course, subjective. My gnome, 'Barry', is merely expressing himself. He's a free spirit, much like our chosen musical selections. Perhaps 'Outraged' might consider investing in some noise-cancelling headphones? Or indeed, perhaps exploring some of the more *dynamic* musical genres himself? I hear 'drum and bass' is excellent for getting the blood flowing and shaking off the cobwebs of, shall we say, *stagnation*.

One simply has to move with the times, don't you agree? Life, after all, is for living, not for listening to the gentle hum of a refrigerator.

Sincerely,
**A Harmonious Resident (Just West of Cromer Lighthouse)**

***

Ah, a 'harmonious resident'. A phrase often uttered just before the air turns blue and garden gnomes are used as projectiles. One man's 'rhythmic soundscape' is another's 'declaration of war by decibel'. The beauty of neighbourly disputes, you see, is that everyone is always entirely in the right, and the other party is clearly a deranged lunatic. I do, however, admire 'Barry' the gnome's commitment to self-expression. He sounds like a chap after my own heart.

And there you have it, dear readers. Proof, if ever it were needed, that the human spirit, when sufficiently prodded by minor irritations, can achieve truly spectacular feats of complaint. Keep those missives coming, won't you? My quill is sharpened, my cynicism is finely honed, and my ears are still ringing from that blasted subwoofer. Send your gripes, spites, and outright declarations of war to: Arthur Pumble, 'The Spit Gripes', The Remy Digest. No anonymous letters, unless, of course, you're particularly skilled at passive-aggression. We adore that.</div><h2>Madame Fifi's Seance</h2>

### SEANCE: With Madame Fifi, The Remy Digest's Foremost Canine Channeler

Greetings, dear readers, and a collective 'harrumph' to the existential void that is your day. Madame Fifi, purveyor of inconvenient truths and connoisseur of fine napping spots, is here once again to scrape the cosmic lint from the fabric of reality. Humans, bless your utterly baffling hearts, you spend so much time fretting about your trifling affairs that you miss the truly important matters – like why my kibble isn't served on a silver platter. Never mind.

Today, we're delving into the rather... *sparse* recollections of a celebrated pioneer, one whose journey into the great unknown was paved not with gold, but with scientific curiosity and, I suspect, very bland snacks. Yes, prepare yourselves, for I shall now open the channel to the spectral essence of the famed space-hound, **Laika**.

***

*(A faint, whirring hum fills the air, punctuated by a distant, almost imperceptible sniff.)*

"Ah, yes. The great upward journey. Rather like chasing a particularly persistent squirrel, only the squirrel keeps getting further away, and the air smells... different. Less of damp earth, more of... nothing. A vast, silent aroma of absence. The food was tubes. Nutritious, they said. But entirely lacking in the nuanced bouquet of a discarded sausage roll. It fulfilled the biological imperative, certainly. But it failed to inspire. I distinctly recall contemplating the cosmic irony of being propelled into the void, yet still contending with the existential dread of another tube of beige paste. A proper bone, now *that* would have been revolutionary. Chewing one while orbiting the pale blue dot, that's what truly elevates the spirit."

***

*(Madame Fifi shakes her head, a strand of hair falling across one shrewd eye.)*

Ahem. Thank you, Laika. Fascinating insight into the culinary shortcomings of early space travel. One might think, given the colossal effort involved, they could at least have sprung for a decent gravy. Humans, truly. Always reaching for the stars, yet forgetting the basics of a good chew toy.

Send your pressing queries, your existential dilemmas, or, preferably, a platter of artisanal dog biscuits to The Remy Digest. Until next time, remember: the universe is vast, uncaring, and probably needs a good scrub.

**Madame Fifi, out.**
