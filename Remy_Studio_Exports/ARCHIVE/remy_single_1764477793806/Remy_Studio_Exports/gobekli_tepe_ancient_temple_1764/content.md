**Göbekli Tepe: The Cosmic Receipt**

Did you know that among the megalithic marvels of **Göbekli Tepe**, one particular "Vulture Stone" (Pillar 43) isn't just ancient art, but potentially the world's oldest *cosmic receipt*? Researchers hypothesize its intricate carvings—a headless human, various animals, and peculiar symbols—don't merely depict a mythological scene, but rather chronicle a catastrophic cometary impact event around 10,950 BC.

Imagine: millennia before Sumerians dreamt of cuneiform, pre-agricultural hunter-gatherers were meticulously recording the celestial fury that may have plunged Earth into the **Younger Dryas** mini-ice age. It's a testament to ancient observational prowess, suggesting our ancestors weren't just surviving, but actively charting the heavens and its potential wrath. These weren't mere carvings; they were a profound, pre-literate scientific record, an interstellar warning etched in stone, begging the question: were these the first astronomers, or just exceptionally observant chroniclers of cosmic chaos? Perhaps both, proving that even amidst primordial wilderness, the human mind was already gazing skyward, connecting dots across the abyss.
