  <h2>No Receipts, Mate? Dee Why Gets $11M While the Nation Goes Croc-Crazy</h2>

  <p>Right, so the promised land of political transparency is, once again, less 'promised' and more 'pipe dream'. The digital paper trail? Vanished faster than a sausage roll at a koala convention. Allegedly "offline". Convenient, wouldn't you say? Meanwhile, the Duopoly continues its dance of deception, leaving us to ponder whether our democracy is less a functional government and more a poorly written reality TV show.</p>

  <h2>Meanwhile, in the Bubble</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Dee Why Development Approved:</b> Another $11 million development gets the green light. That's great news if you own stock in a concrete company. The rest of us can enjoy the shade cast by more soulless apartment blocks. Check out the full DA Round Up for a masterclass in bureaucracy.</li>
    <li><b>Manly Warringah Choir Hits 50:</b> Congratulations to the Manly Warringah Choir for reaching 50 years. Music to our ears, literally. A distraction from the impending apocalypse, perhaps?</li>
    <li><b>Scammers Strike Again:</b> Locals are losing thousands to scammers. Stay vigilant, folks. Your prize money from the Nigerian prince probably doesn't exist. And your long-lost relative? Highly likely a bot farm in Vladivostok.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Going Troppo</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Croc Grabs Dog:</b> A pet dog has been snatched by a crocodile at a popular resort beach in Cairns. That's North Queensland for you. Note to self: Reconsider that beach holiday. Consider a hamster instead of a dog. The hamster should stay indoors.</li>
    <li><b>Heart Attack Survival in the NT:</b> One bloke's near-death experience in remote NT. A ‘long road back’ after a heart attack. Makes you appreciate the convenience of… well, everything, doesn't it? At least the leeches got a good feed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, there you have it. Political machinations shrouded in secrecy, local council decisions that make your head spin, and the wildlife trying to kill you. Just another day in paradise, folks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a tin-foil hat and a lifetime supply of instant noodles.</p>
