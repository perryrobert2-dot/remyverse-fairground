*(Originally published in The Remy Digest, Satirical Broadsheet)*

My dearest readers,

One finds, perched precariously as I often am on the precipice of cultural despair, that the wellsprings of genuine artistic endeavour seem to have run dry. Or, perhaps, they have merely been redirected into drains, to be diluted and repurposed by the municipal powers-that-be. For what passes as "art" today often strikes this particular ibis as little more than the enthusiastic redecoration of the bin — a noble pursuit, mind you, but one that rarely justifies the clamour of critical adulation.

Yet, from time to time, a work emerges from the unlikeliest of sources, so devoid of traditional merit, so bereft of intent, that it transcends mere banality and achieves a certain, shall we say, *negative profundity*. It is to such a piece that my keen, discerning eye – accustomed, as it is, to sifting through the dross of existence for the occasional glint of edible truth – was recently drawn.

I speak, of course, of a headline. Not merely *any* headline, mind you, but one plucked, like a particularly unappetizing chip, from the venerable pages of *The Cronulla Leader*. This regional publication, known more for its steadfast commitment to the utterly un-newsworthy than for any journalistic pyrotechnics, recently delivered a masterpiece of the anti-sensational. It read, in its stark, unforgiving glory:

**"Park Bench Dedicated to Long-Serving Librarian Remains Undisturbed."**

Ah, the shivers! The sheer, unadulterated *nothingness* of it all! Here, my friends, we encounter not merely minimalism, but a chilling, almost liturgical form of **Minimalist Nihilism**.

Let us dissect this monumental non-event, shall we?

Firstly, the subject: "Park Bench." A symbol of repose, contemplation, community. A locus of human interaction, however fleeting. A place where dreams might be spun, or discarded. A stage, however humble, for the drama of the everyday.

Secondly, its dedication: "to Long-Serving Librarian." A nod to service, to the quiet accumulation of knowledge, to the noble, often thankless, task of fostering literacy. It implies history, a legacy, a human footprint left upon the sands of time. One imagines speeches, perhaps a modest ribbon-cutting, a collective sigh of appreciation from those who've benefited from decades of literary guidance.

But then, the denouement. The devastating, soul-crushing twist: **"Remains Undisturbed."**

"Undisturbed." It is the whisper of the void, the quiet echo of an existential scream unheard. No jubilant congregation of picnickers. No impromptu street performer using it as a prop. No miscreant defacing it with poorly considered graffiti. Not even a single, solitary ibis, such as myself, perched upon its backrest, contemplating the inherent irony of human endeavour. It just *is*. It sits there, stoic, silent, and utterly unmolested by the inconvenient clamour of existence.

This, dear readers, is Minimalist Nihilism in its purest, most unsettling form. It is the art of the anti-event, the glorification of inertia. The editor, whether consciously or through some sublime, subconscious channeling of the collective ennui, has presented us with a tableau of profound absence. It is a work that dares us to seek meaning where none is intended, to find drama in the utter lack of it. It poses the question: if a dedicated park bench sits in a park and no one interacts with it, does it even make a sound? The answer, according to *The Cronulla Leader*, is a resounding, echoing silence.

One could argue that this headline is merely poor journalism, a filler piece born of a particularly slow news day. But I, Cornelius, beg to differ. I see it as a courageous, if unintentional, act of artistic defiance. It rejects the vulgar sensationalism of the tabloids, the saccharine sentimentality of human interest pieces, and the manufactured outrage of political reportage. It embraces the unvarnished, unadulterated truth of urban stasis. It is the ultimate expression of "so what?" rendered with a journalistic gravitas that would make Kafka weep into his morning coffee.

I tell you, I pecked at my breakfast scraps with renewed vigour that morning. For in that one magnificent non-story, I saw the true face of our modern age: beautifully appointed, meticulously dedicated, and utterly, profoundly undisturbed.

Until next time, keep those bins accessible, and your wits about you.

Yours in cynical contemplation,

Cornelius
