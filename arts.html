**By Cornelius, Arts Critic for 'The Remy Digest'**

One preens, one observes, one endures. My beak, long accustomed to sifting through the detritus of human endeavour for any morsel of meaning, often finds itself... empty. This week, however, a particularly potent specimen landed on my desk, plucked from the seemingly innocuous pages of *The Cronulla Leader*. Oh, the unassuming packaging! One might mistake it for mere reportage, a fleeting whisper of the mundane. But those of us with the courage – or perhaps, the curse – to gaze into the abyss know better.

The piece in question, stark and unadorned, bore the title:

## Cronulla Council Approves Minor Revisions to Park Bench Acquisition Policy.

At first glance, the uninitiated might dismiss this as a bureaucratic blip, a prosaic note in the grand symphony of municipal tedium. But I, Cornelius, declare it a masterstroke of what I’ve termed *Minimalist Nihilism*.

Consider the artist's audacious choice of canvas: the local newspaper headline. A public space, yet one designed for fleeting attention, for the rapid consumption and even more rapid forgetting of local tidings. Here, the artist – presumably the collective unconscious of the Cronulla Council itself – presents us with a work utterly devoid of colour, of emotion, of even the barest hint of human struggle or triumph.

"Minor Revisions." The audacity! This is not a bold re-imagining, not a revolutionary overturning of established norms. No, it is a deliberate, almost defiant embrace of the inconsequential. It speaks to a universe where change itself is so attenuated, so utterly devoid of impact, that it barely registers. It is the whimper, not the bang, of existential dread, meticulously rendered in bureaucratic prose.

And the subject matter: "Park Bench Acquisition Policy." Not the benches themselves, mind you, with their potential for repose, contemplation, or illicit trysts. No, the *policy for acquiring* them. The abstraction of the object, further abstracted into its procedural shadow. It is a work that deliberately removes any potential for human connection, for aesthetic appreciation, or even for simple utility. It presents us with the bare, skeletal framework of existence, polished clean of meaning.

The piece offers no solace, no beauty, no grand narrative. It simply *is*. It stands as a chilling testament to the void that lurks beneath the veneer of organised society, a stark reminder that even the most meticulously crafted systems ultimately churn out... nothing. Or, perhaps, an infinitesimally small adjustment to the process of acquiring an object for sitting. The very act of "approval" feels less like a decision and more like a slow, inevitable grind towards... well, towards more policy.

This is art that doesn't ask a question; it *is* the question, delivered with the icy precision of a well-sharpened quill. It whispers, "Is this all there is?" and then provides no answer, leaving only the hollow echo of a budget line item. It's a scream of silent despair, meticulously categorised.

I daresay future generations will look back at this period and wonder what possessed us. Was this a cry for help? A satire so subtle it became indistinguishable from reality? Or merely the logical endpoint of a society so obsessed with process it forgot purpose? As I shake the crumbs of existential dread from my feathers, I can only conclude that if this is the pinnacle of Cronulla's cultural output, we are truly, spectacularly, doomed. And the benches, one assumes, will still be acquired. Eventually. According to policy.
